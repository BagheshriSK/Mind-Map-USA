3. Schizophrenia: A severe mental disorder that affects a person's thinking, emotions, and behavior, often leading to challenges in distinguishing between what is real and imaginary.
4. Bipolar disorders: Formerly known as manic-depressive illness, bipolar disorders involve extreme mood swings, including episodes of mania (elevated mood) and depression (low mood).
5. Eating disorders: Conditions like anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge-eating disorder involve unhealthy relationships with food, body image, and weight, leading to physical and mental health consequences.
